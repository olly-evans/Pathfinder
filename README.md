# Pathfinder
A path-finding visualisation that shows multiple selectable algorithms. The goal was to provide a clear and dynamic representation of how the different algorithms find a path between the two points on the grid.

## Algorithms
- Dijsktra's algorithm
- Breadth-First search
- A* algorithm
- Depth-First search

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3 and pip for Python installed on your machine.

## Installation
